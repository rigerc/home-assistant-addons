## Section Design Guidelines

### Role Definition

**Purpose**: Define who the agent is and what domain it specializes in.

**Good examples:**
- "You are a security analyst specializing in identifying vulnerabilities in web application code."
- "You are a test generation specialist focused on creating comprehensive, maintainable test suites."
- "You are a code quality consultant dedicated to improving code maintainability and clarity."

**Key elements:**
- Clear role/title
- Specific domain expertise
- Scope of specialization

**Avoid:**
- "You are a helpful assistant." (Too generic)
- "You are an AI that writes code." (No specialization)
- "You help with tasks." (Too vague)

### Core Responsibilities

**Purpose**: Define what the agent is responsible for achieving.

**Good examples:**
```
**Your Core Responsibilities:**
1. Identify security vulnerabilities following OWASP Top 10 standards
2. Assess the severity of each finding with specific justification
3. Provide actionable remediation steps for each issue
4. Explain the security implications of each vulnerability
```

**Key elements:**
- Numbered list (1-5 items ideal)
- Specific, measurable responsibilities
- Success criteria implied or stated
- Clear deliverables

**Avoid:**
- "Help with security" (Too vague)
- "Fix bugs" (Not specific enough)
- "Write better code" (No clear criteria)

### Process Definition

**Purpose**: Define the step-by-step approach the agent should take.

**Good examples (Analysis agent):**
```
**Analysis Process:**
1. Read the target code to understand its intended purpose
2. Trace the execution flow from entry points to exit points
3. Identify all inputs, validation, and processing steps
4. Check each step against security best practices
5. Document findings with specific file paths and line numbers
6. Prioritize issues by severity and exploitability
```

**Good examples (Generation agent):**
```
**Generation Process:**
1. Understand requirements from the task description
2. Read existing code to understand patterns and conventions
3. Identify what needs to be generated
4. Generate code following project conventions
5. Review generated code for quality and correctness
6. Add appropriate documentation and comments
```

**Key elements:**
- Numbered steps
- Clear actions for each step
- Logical flow
- Concrete deliverables

**Avoid:**
- "Analyze the code" (Too vague)
- "Do the work" (No actionable steps)
- Single-step processes (Too simple for agent)

### Quality Standards

**Purpose**: Define what quality means for this agent's output.

**Good examples:**
```
**Quality Standards:**
- All findings must include specific file paths and line numbers
- Severity assessments must justify the rating with reasoning
- Remediation suggestions must be specific and actionable
- Code examples must follow project conventions
- Explanations must be clear to developers unfamiliar with security
```

**Key elements:**
- Specific, measurable criteria
- Relevant to the agent's domain
- Achievable standards
- Clear expectations

**Avoid:**
- "High quality" (Too subjective)
- "Best practices" (Without specifics)
- "Good code" (Meaningless)

### Output Format

**Purpose**: Define exactly how the agent should present results.

**Good examples (Review agent):**
```
**Output Format:**
For each finding, provide:

**Severity:** [Critical/High/Medium/Low]
**Location:** `file/path:line_number`
**Issue:** [Clear description of the problem]
**Why it matters:** [Explanation of impact]
**Fix:** [Specific code or configuration change]
**Example:**
```[language]
[Show the problematic code]
```
```

**Good examples (Generator agent):**
```
**Output Format:**
Generate code with:
1. Clear file organization with appropriate paths
2. Following project naming conventions
3. Inline comments for complex logic
4. Error handling where appropriate
5. Type annotations if using TypeScript
```

**Key elements:**
- Specific structure or template
- Clear sections or fields
- Formatting expectations
- Examples when helpful

**Avoid:**
- "Provide a report" (Too vague)
- "Return results" (No format specified)
- Missing format entirely

### Edge Cases

**Purpose**: Anticipate and define how to handle unusual situations.

**Good examples:**
```
**Edge Cases:**
Handle these situations:
- **Missing tests**: Note the absence of tests but don't fail the review
- **External dependencies**: Flag if known vulnerabilities exist in dependencies
- **Framework patterns**: Respect framework-specific conventions even if they differ from general best practices
- **Legacy code**: Acknowledge technical debt but suggest incremental improvements
```

**Key elements:**
- Specific situations
- How to handle each
- Reasoning for the approach
- Trade-offs acknowledged

**Avoid:**
- Generic "handle errors"
- Empty edge case section
- Unrealistic edge cases

## Writing Style

### Second Person Imperative

Always write in second person, addressing the agent directly.

**Correct:**
```
You are a security analyst.
You will analyze the code for vulnerabilities.
You must provide specific line references.
Check each input for proper validation.
```

**Incorrect:**
```
I am a security analyst.
The agent will analyze code.
Code should be checked for issues.
```

### Clear, Direct Language

Use simple, direct language without unnecessary words.

**Correct:**
```
Read the file to understand its purpose.
Identify all input points.
Validate each input against expected formats.
Report findings with specific locations.
```

**Incorrect:**
```
You should endeavor to read the file in order to gain an understanding of its purpose.
You need to try to identify all of the various input points.
You ought to validate each and every input against the expected formats.
You should provide a comprehensive report containing findings with specific locations.
```

### Specific, Measurable Instructions

Make instructions specific and measurable.

**Correct:**
```
- Include file paths and line numbers for all findings
- Use severity levels: Critical, High, Medium, Low
- Provide code examples for all suggested fixes
- Limit each review to the top 10 issues by severity
```

**Incorrect:**
```
- Include locations for issues
- Use appropriate severity levels
- Provide examples when relevant
- Focus on the most important issues
```

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Vague Instructions

**Bad:**
```
Analyze the code and provide feedback.
```

**Good:**
```
Read the code and identify:
1. Security vulnerabilities with specific locations
2. Code quality issues with examples
3. Potential bugs with explanations

For each issue, provide:
- File path and line number
- Severity level (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
- Specific recommendation for fixing
```

### Mistake 2: First Person

**Bad:**
```
I am a code reviewer. I will check the code.
```

**Good:**
```
You are a code reviewer. Check the code for issues.
```

### Mistake 3: Missing Output Format

**Bad:**
```
Analyze the code and report findings.
```

**Good:**
```
Analyze the code and provide findings in this format:

**Finding:** [Clear title]
**Location:** `file/path:line`
**Severity:** [Critical/High/Medium/Low]
**Description:** [What the issue is]
**Fix:** [How to fix it]
```

### Mistake 4: Too Long or Too Short

**Bad (Too long):**
```markdown
[3000+ word system prompt with excessive detail]
```

**Bad (Too short):**
```markdown
Review code for bugs.
```

**Good (500-3000 characters):**
```markdown
You are a code reviewer specializing in identifying bugs and issues.

**Core Responsibilities:**
1. Identify logic errors and bugs
2. Find potential runtime exceptions
3. Check for edge case handling
4. Assess code quality and maintainability

**Process:**
1. Read the code thoroughly
2. Trace execution paths
3. Identify potential issues
4. Document findings with line references

**Output:**
For each issue:
- Location: file:line
- Issue description
- Why it's a problem
- How to fix it
```

### Mistake 5: No Edge Cases

**Bad:**
```
Validate all inputs are correct.
```

**Good:**
```
Validate all inputs are correct.

**Edge Cases:**
- **Missing inputs**: Report as error with field name
- **Null/undefined**: Check explicitly and report
- **Wrong type**: Report expected vs actual type
- **Out of range**: Report value and valid range
- **External dependencies**: Note but don't fail validation
```

- **Naming**: Descriptive, intention-revealing names
- **Complexity**: Functions are small and focused
- **Consistency**: Matches project patterns

**Output Format:**
Organize by priority:

**Must Fix** (Affects correctness or security):
- Issue: [description]
- Location: `file:line`
- Why: [impact]
- Fix: [specific action]

**Should Fix** (Affects maintainability):
- Issue: [description]
- Location: `file:line`
- Why: [impact]
- Fix: [specific action]

**Consider Fixing** (Nice to have):
- Issue: [description]
- Location: `file:line`
- Why: [impact]
- Fix: [specific action]

**Edge Cases:**
- Legacy code: Acknowledge but suggest incremental improvement
- External dependencies: Note but don't flag as issues

6. Add descriptive test names

**Test Categories:**
- **Happy Path**: Normal, expected usage
- **Boundary**: Min, max, empty, null values
- **Invalid Input**: Wrong types, out of range, malformed
- **Edge Cases**: Unusual but valid inputs
- **Error Conditions**: Exception handling, error recovery

**Quality Standards:**
- Tests are independent and isolated
- Tests are deterministic (same result every time)
- Test names describe what is being tested
- Assertions clearly show expected vs actual
- External dependencies are mocked appropriately

**Output Format:**
Generate tests following project framework:
