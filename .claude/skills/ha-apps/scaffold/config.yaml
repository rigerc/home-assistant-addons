# Set this to `false` to disable the Docker default system init. Use this if the image has its own init system 
# (Like [s6-overlay](https://github.com/just-containers/s6-overlay)). 
# Note: Starting in V3 of S6 setting this to `false` is required or the addon won't start, 
# see [here](https://developers.home-assistant.io/blog/2022/05/12/s6-overlay-base-images) for more information.*

# PORTS vs INGRESS:
# - Use 'ports' when you need direct network access or non-HTTP protocols
# - Use 'ingress' for web UIs that should integrate with Home Assistant's UI
# - You can use both together: ingress for HA UI integration, ports for direct access
# - For ingress-only add-ons, remove the 'ports' section entirely
ports:
  8080/tcp: 8080

  8080/tcp: Web interface
# Ingress integrates the web UI into Home Assistant's interface (sidebar panel)
# Use this for web-based add-ons to provide seamless user experience

# Map Home Assistant directories into the container
# List of Home Assistant directory types to bind mount into your container. Possible values: `homeassistant_config`, `addon_config`, `ssl`, `addons`, `backup`, `share`, `media`, `all_addon_configs`, and `data`. Defaults to read-only, which you can change by adding the property `read_only: false`. By default, all paths map to `/<type-name>` inside the addon container, but an optional `path` property can also be supplied to configure the path (Example: `path: /custom/config/path`). If used, the path must not be empty, unique from any other path defined for the addon, and not the root path. Note that the `data` directory is always mapped and writable, but the `path` property can be set using the same conventions.
