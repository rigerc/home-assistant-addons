# PORTS vs INGRESS:
# - Use 'ports' when you need direct network access or non-HTTP protocols
# - Use 'ingress' for web UIs that should integrate with Home Assistant's UI
# - You can use both together: ingress for HA UI integration, ports for direct access
# - For ingress-only add-ons, remove the 'ports' section entirely
